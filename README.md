* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Use your IDE of choice to complete the assignment.
* When you have completed the assignment, you need to  push your code to this repository and [mark the assignment as completed by clicking here](https://app.snapcode.review/submission_links/9a1b74b0-e0cd-465f-8375-b226b48e2654).
* Once you mark it as completed, your access to this repository will be revoked. Please make sure that you have completed the assignment and pushed all code from your local machine to this repository before you click the link.
* There is no time limit for this task - however, for guidance, it is expected to typically take around 1-2 hours.

# Begin the task

Write some code that provides the following basic shopping cart capabilities:

1. Add a product to the cart
   1. Specifying the product name and quantity
   2. Retrieve the product price by issuing a request to the [Price API](#price-api) specified below
   3. Cart state (totals, etc.) must be available

2. Calculate the state:
   1. Cart subtotal (sum of price for all items)
   2. Tax payable (charged at 12.5% on the subtotal)
   3. Total payable (subtotal + tax)
   4. Totals should be rounded up where required (to two decimal places)

## Price API

The price API is an existing API that returns the price details for a product, identified by it's name. The shopping cart should integrate with the price API to retrieve product prices. 

### Price API Service Details

Base URL: `https://equalexperts.github.io/`

View Product: `GET /backend-take-home-test-data/{product}.json`

List of available products
* `cheerios`
* `cornflakes`
* `frosties`
* `shreddies`
* `weetabix`

## Example
The below is a sample with the correct values you can use to confirm your calculations

### Inputs
* Add 1 × cornflakes @ 2.52 each
* Add another 1 x cornflakes @2.52 each
* Add 1 × weetabix @ 9.98 each
  
### Results  
* Cart contains 2 x cornflakes
* Cart contains 1 x weetabix
* Subtotal = 15.02
* Tax = 1.88
* Total = 16.90

## Tips on what we’re looking for

We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and as a development practice. Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and shouldn’t be overly complex. We prefer simple, well tested solutions over clever solutions. 

### DO

* ✅ Include unit tests.
* ✅ Test both any client and logic.
* ✅ Update the README.md with any relevant information, assumptions, and/or tradeoffs you would like to highlight.

### DO NOT

* ❌ Submit any form of app, such as web APIs, browser, desktop, or command-line applications.
* ❌ Add unnecessary layers of abstraction.
* ❌ Add unnecessary patterns/ architectural features that aren’t called for e.g. persistent storage.

### AI Tool Usage

While we encourage the use of AI tools as part of the learning process but to ensure transparency, please provide the following information regarding the use of AI tools in this submission:

1.  **Specific Use Cases:** Describe for what purposes tool was used (e.g., code generation, debugging assistance, query generation etc.).
2.  **Percentage of Code Generated by AI:** Provide an estimate of the percentage of the submitted code that was generated by AI.
3.  **How AI-Generated Code Was Reviewed:** Explain how you reviewed and verified the AI-generated code to ensure its correctness and quality.

Please note, during the technical interview, which will build upon this exercise, we'll focus on your coding abilities and problem-solving skills without the use of AI tools. This will allow us to see your direct approach and thought process.
### AI was used for the following purpose. 
1. Convert a piece of java code logic to use lambdas. 
Created some test cases to test thread safety for some of the test methods.
Review my code and suggest improvements with regards to thread safety and immutability.
2. I would estimate 20 % of project code was generated by AI.
3. The AI code was reviewed by code walkthrough and tested by the junit test cases.

### Other relevant information / Assumptions
1. I took into account that product price changes should not affect cart product prices as these would have already been checkout out at the price at the time.
2. I did not add any patterns such as builder or creational patterns or use any framework such as Springboot.
3. I added the junit library for testing, Jackson library for mapping and mockito for mocking objects.
4. Java version 17 was used.  

### Steps to compile build and run unit tests
From the bash command line in the project root directory you can run the following commands. 
./gradlew compileJava
./gradlew build
./gradlew test
